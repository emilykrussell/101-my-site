    		<h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
    			<div class="half-width">
    			<p>My start in tech was by happenstance - working in sales for the graphic industry, I was exposed to design and instantly knew I needed to learn the art.  After some time, I decided to learn development as a hobby, but quickly grew to much more than that. 
    			</p>
    			</div>
    			<div class="half-width">
    			<p>I am fascinated by simple, classic design styles and I strive to create new interpretations of those inspirations every day.  The ability to create design and bring it to life through development is my passion.
                </p>
                <p>When I'm not deep in design or working on code, you can find me at home in Carolina with my husband and our two pups.
